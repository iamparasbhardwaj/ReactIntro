          name: 'Lionel',
          age: 30
        }

        // We write the normal javascript function
        // The event argument here is taken automatically and we don't have to pass it from the component.

          console.log(e.target);

          /*
            this.state is giving undefined.
             It is not accessing the state here but it's accessing in JSX, why?
             The reason is -- the value of 'this' in the two locations
             'this' keyword loses the context in the where the functions sits

             This is how Javascript works-- the context of the 'this' is defined by the function it calls
             and not by the position where function sits.

             The 'this' keyword in the JSX remains because the context is within the rendered react component.

             We have to bind the 'this' keyword manually to our custom functions unlike 'this' inside the JSX.

             We use arrow functions here. And here this will work.
              ---> handleClick = (e) => {} --- it binds the 'this' instance of the class App to the function.
            Once we change it it will be able to access the instance.

                   We use camel case to write the event we want to use.
                   Then we use curly braces because now we want a JS function to be called
                   and we define the function (can be anyname of choice) and call it here with 'this'
                   'this' specifies that the component it is fired in.
                  we do not want to invoke the fumction so we don't use ()
